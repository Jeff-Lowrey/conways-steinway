# Conway's Steinway Configuration File
# This file uses Java-style properties format

# ----- Core Configuration -----

# Board initialization type: "random", "static", "fur_elise", "complex", or "showcase"
board.type = random

# Add 'silent' property to disable audio output
# Audio is enabled by default. Just including this key enables silent mode.
# silent

# Generation limit - use "unlimited" or a number
# Examples:
# generations = 50       # Run for 50 generations
# generations = unlimited # Run indefinitely (default)
generations = unlimited

# Delay between steps in milliseconds (ignored if tempo.bpm is set)
step.delay.ms = 200

# Musical tempo in beats per minute (optional, overrides step.delay.ms)
# Examples:
# tempo.bpm = 120.0    # Moderate tempo  
# tempo.bpm = 126.0    # FÃ¼r Elise tempo (set automatically)
# Leave commented to use step.delay.ms instead
# tempo.bpm = 120.0

# ----- Audio Settings -----

# Note duration in milliseconds for sequential note playback
audio.note.duration.ms = 200

# Gap between notes in milliseconds for sequential note playback
audio.gap.ms = 50

# Chord duration in milliseconds
audio.chord.duration.ms = 300

# Initial note delay in milliseconds
audio.initial.delay.ms = 50

# Detect chord patterns automatically
audio.detect.chords = true

# Volume level for audio output (0.0-1.0)
audio.volume = 0.6

# Enable pitch shifting for better chromatic range
audio.pitch.shift = true

# ----- Random Board Settings -----

# Random initial cells probability (0.0-1.0)
# For the "random" board type, this controls how many cells start alive
random.alive.probability = 0.2

# ----- Board Dimensions -----

# NOTE: Board width is ALWAYS 88 cells to match piano keys and CANNOT be changed.
# This is a fixed requirement to match piano keys and is not configurable.

# Board height (default: 40 cells)
board.height = 40
