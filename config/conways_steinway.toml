# Conway's Steinway Unified Configuration File
# This file is used by both Python and Rust implementations

# ----- Core Configuration -----

# Board initialization type: "random", "static", "fur_elise", "complex", or "showcase"
# All implementations will use the same format (lowercase with underscores)
board_type = "random"

# Add 'silent' property to disable audio output
# Just including this property (without value) will enable silent mode
# silent

# Generation limit: use { limited = N } or "unlimited"
# Default: unlimited (except fur_elise ALWAYS uses 80 for full song)
# Examples:
# generations = { limited = 50 }   # Run for 50 generations
# generations = "unlimited"        # Run indefinitely (default)
generations = "unlimited"

# Delay between steps in milliseconds (ignored if tempo_bpm is set)
step_delay_ms = 200

# Musical tempo in beats per minute (optional, overrides step_delay_ms)
# Examples:
# tempo_bpm = 120.0    # Moderate tempo  
# tempo_bpm = 126.0    # FÃ¼r Elise tempo (set automatically)
# Leave commented to use step_delay_ms instead
# tempo_bpm = 120.0

# Audio settings
[audio]
# Note duration in milliseconds for sequential note playback
# note_duration_ms = 200

# Gap between notes in milliseconds for sequential note playback
# gap_ms = 50

# Chord duration in milliseconds
# chord_duration_ms = 300

# Initial note delay in milliseconds
# initial_delay_ms = 50

# Detect chord patterns automatically
# detect_chords = true

# Random initial cells probability (0.0-1.0)
# For the "random" board type, this controls how many cells start alive
[random]
# alive_probability = 0.2

# Audio settings continued
# volume = 0.6          # Volume level for audio output (0.0-1.0)
# pitch_shift = true    # Enable pitch shifting for better chromatic range

# ----- Application Settings -----

# Board dimensions
# NOTE: Board width is ALWAYS 88 cells to match piano keys and CANNOT be changed.
# This is a fixed requirement to match piano keys and is not configurable.
[board]
height = 40  # Board height (default: 40 cells)
