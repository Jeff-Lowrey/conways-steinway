# Conway's Steinway - Rust Implementation

A musical implementation of Conway's Game of Life that generates piano music based on cellular automaton evolution. Living cells on the bottom row of the game board are interpreted as piano keys, creating emergent musical compositions.

## Overview

This Rust implementation combines the mathematical beauty of Conway's Game of Life with realistic piano audio synthesis. As the cellular automaton evolves, patterns that reach the bottom row trigger piano notes, creating unique musical experiences with each run.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¹ Realistic Piano Audio
- **High-quality samples**: Uses real piano recordings from multiple vintage synthesizers
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 11 samples covering the full 88-key piano range
- **Intelligent pitch shifting**: Automatically adjusts pitch with volume compensation
- **Smart sample selection**: Minimizes pitch shifting for natural sound
- **Chord detection**: Automatically detects and plays chord patterns with natural timing

### ðŸŽ® Game Configurations
- **Random mode**: Procedurally generated patterns with continuous evolution
- **Complex mode** (`--static`): Pre-designed patterns including gliders, oscillators, spaceships, and methuselahs
- **FÃ¼r Elise mode** (`--fur-elise`): Special configuration designed to play the opening of FÃ¼r Elise
- **Silent mode** (`--silent`): Visual-only mode without audio

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **Modular architecture**: Separate modules for game logic, audio engine, and piano player
- **Sample caching**: Preloads all piano samples for instant playback
- **Fallback synthesis**: Falls back to synthetic generation if samples unavailable
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Audio drivers (typically included with OS)

### Building
```bash
cd rust/life
cargo build --release
```

### Running
```bash
# Random configuration
cargo run

# Complex patterns  
cargo run -- --static

# FÃ¼r Elise melody
cargo run -- --fur-elise

# Silent mode (visual only)
cargo run -- --silent
```

## How It Works

### Game of Life Rules
The implementation follows Conway's classic rules:
1. **Survival**: Live cells with 2-3 neighbors survive
2. **Birth**: Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors become alive
3. **Death**: All other cells die or remain dead

### Musical Interpretation
1. **Piano Mapping**: The 88-column board represents piano keys A0-C8
2. **Note Triggering**: Living cells in the bottom row trigger corresponding piano keys
3. **Pattern Evolution**: The board continuously evolves, creating new musical patterns
4. **Chord Detection**: Multiple adjacent keys trigger chord playback with natural timing

### Audio Engine
The audio system uses a sophisticated sample-based approach:

```
Piano Key â†’ Sample Selection â†’ Pitch Adjustment â†’ Volume Compensation â†’ Playback
     â†“              â†“                â†“                    â†“              â†“
   0-87      Find closest       Calculate shift      Adjust volume    Play sample
           sample (C2-C7)      (Â±12 semitones)      for pitch shift   via Rodio
```

## Architecture

### Core Modules

#### `main.rs`
- Entry point and command-line argument processing
- Game loop coordination
- Board display and generation counting

#### `game_board.rs`
- Static pattern definitions (gliders, oscillators, spaceships, etc.)
- Board manipulation utilities
- Complex pattern generators including FÃ¼r Elise configuration

#### `audio.rs`
- `AudioEngine`: Sample-based piano synthesis
- `NullAudioEngine`: Silent mode implementation
- Sample loading, caching, and playback management
- Intelligent pitch shifting and volume compensation

#### `piano_player.rs`
- High-level piano interface
- Chord detection algorithms
- Musical pattern recognition

### Key Classes

```rust
pub trait AudioPlayer {
    fn play_piano_keys(&self, keys: &[usize]);
    fn play_chord(&self, keys: &[usize], duration_ms: u64);
    fn play_note_sequence(&self, keys: &[usize], note_duration_ms: u64, gap_ms: u64);
}

pub struct AudioEngine {
    _stream: OutputStream,
    sink: Sink,
    sample_cache: HashMap<usize, Vec<u8>>, // Cached piano samples
}
```

## Piano Samples

The implementation includes high-quality piano samples from various vintage synthesizers:

- **A1** (key 9): Casio VZ-10M Piano
- **A2** (key 21): Ensoniq ESQ-1 Piano  
- **C2** (key 24): Ensoniq SQ-2 Piano
- **C3** (key 36): Multiple sources (Ensoniq SQ-2, Kawai K3)
- **C4** (key 48): Multiple sources (Ensoniq SQ-2, Yamaha TG77 Ivory, Kawai K11)
- **C5** (key 60): Roland SC-88 Grand Piano
- **C6** (key 72): Ensoniq VFX-SD Classic Piano  
- **C7** (key 84): Ensoniq SQ-2 Piano

### Sample Selection Algorithm
The engine automatically selects the closest available sample and applies pitch shifting:
- **Optimal range**: Â±6 semitones from base sample
- **Penalty system**: Discourages large pitch shifts for natural sound
- **Volume compensation**: Adjusts volume based on pitch shift direction

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
hound = "3.5"    # WAV file generation and processing
rodio = "0.17"   # Cross-platform audio playback
```

## Performance

- **Memory usage**: ~15MB for piano samples + minimal game state
- **CPU usage**: Low, optimized cellular automaton calculations
- **Audio latency**: Sub-10ms sample triggering
- **Real-time**: 60+ FPS game visualization with audio

## Customization

### Adding New Patterns
Add patterns to `game_board.rs`:

```rust
pub fn create_my_pattern(game: &mut GameOfLife, row: usize, col: usize) {
    game.set_cell(row, col, Cell::Alive);
    game.set_cell(row, col + 1, Cell::Alive);
    // ... define your pattern
}
```

### Custom Board Configurations
Create new board generators:

```rust
pub fn create_my_board() -> GameOfLife {
    let mut game = GameOfLife::new();
    Self::create_my_pattern(&mut game, 10, 20);
    // ... add more patterns
    game
}
```

## Known Limitations

- **Sample coverage**: Uses pitch shifting for keys without direct samples
- **Polyphony**: Limited by system audio capabilities
- **File size**: Piano samples add ~15MB to repository
