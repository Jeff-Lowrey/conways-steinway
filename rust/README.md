# Conway's Steinway - Rust Implementation

A musical implementation of Conway's Game of Life that generates piano music based on cellular automaton evolution. Living cells on the bottom row of the game board are interpreted as piano keys, creating emergent musical compositions.

## Overview

This Rust implementation combines the mathematical beauty of Conway's Game of Life with realistic piano audio synthesis. As the cellular automaton evolves, patterns that reach the bottom row trigger piano notes, creating unique musical experiences with each run.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¹ Realistic Piano Audio
- **High-quality samples**: Uses real piano recordings from multiple vintage synthesizers
- **Comprehensive chromatic coverage**: 17 samples covering the full 88-key piano range with excellent sharp/flat note support
- **Advanced pitch shifting**: Intelligent sample selection with minimal pitch adjustment (typically â‰¤2 semitones)
- **Smart sample mapping**: Chromatic-aware algorithms prioritize natural-sounding note selection
- **Professional volume compensation**: Dynamic adjustment based on pitch shift distance and direction
- **Chord detection**: Automatically detects and plays chord patterns with natural timing and staggered attacks

### ðŸŽ® Game Configurations
- **Random mode**: Procedurally generated patterns with continuous evolution
- **Complex mode** (`--static`): Pre-designed patterns including gliders, oscillators, spaceships, and methuselahs
- **FÃ¼r Elise mode** (`--fur-elise`): Special configuration designed to play the opening of FÃ¼r Elise
- **Silent mode** (`--silent`): Visual-only mode without audio

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **Modular architecture**: Separate modules for game logic, audio engine, and piano player
- **Advanced sample caching**: Preloads 17 high-quality piano samples for instant playback
- **Chromatic coverage analysis**: Real-time reporting of note coverage and pitch shift requirements
- **Intelligent sample selection**: Multi-layered penalty system for optimal audio quality
- **Fallback synthesis**: Falls back to synthetic generation if samples unavailable
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Audio drivers (typically included with OS)

### Building
```bash
cd rust/life
cargo build --release
```

### Running
```bash
# Random configuration
cargo run

# Complex patterns  
cargo run -- --static

# FÃ¼r Elise melody
cargo run -- --fur-elise

# Silent mode (visual only)
cargo run -- --silent
```

## How It Works

### Game of Life Rules
The implementation follows Conway's classic rules:
1. **Survival**: Live cells with 2-3 neighbors survive
2. **Birth**: Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors become alive
3. **Death**: All other cells die or remain dead

### Musical Interpretation
1. **Piano Mapping**: The 88-column board represents piano keys A0-C8
2. **Note Triggering**: Living cells in the bottom row trigger corresponding piano keys
3. **Pattern Evolution**: The board continuously evolves, creating new musical patterns
4. **Chord Detection**: Multiple adjacent keys trigger chord playback with natural timing

### Audio Engine
The audio system uses a sophisticated sample-based approach:

```
Piano Key â†’ Chromatic Analysis â†’ Sample Selection â†’ Pitch Adjustment â†’ Volume Compensation â†’ Playback
     â†“              â†“                   â†“               â†“                    â†“              â†“
   0-87      Penalty calculation    Find optimal    Calculate shift     Advanced scaling   Play sample
          for distance/quality    sample (17 opts)  (typically â‰¤2 sem)  with bounds check   via Rodio
```

    sample_cache: HashMap<usize, Vec<u8>>, // Cached piano samples
}
```

## Piano Samples

The implementation includes high-quality piano samples with comprehensive chromatic coverage:

### **Low Range (Bass)**
- **D#1** (key 9): Casio VZ-10M Piano - Deep bass foundation
- **D#2** (key 21): Ensoniq ESQ-1 Piano - Low bass register  
- **F#2** (key 24): Ensoniq SQ-2 Piano - Bass register

### **Mid-Low Range (Better Chromatic Coverage)**
- **F#3** (key 36): Ensoniq SQ-2 Piano + Kawai K3 (multiple sources)
- **G#3** (key 38): E-Mu Proteus FX Pianotar - **Sharp note coverage**
- **B4** (key 41): Alesis Fusion Bright Acoustic Piano - **Natural note**
- **C#4** (key 43): Alesis Fusion Bright Acoustic Piano - **Sharp note coverage**

### **Mid Range (Optimal Coverage)**
- **F#4** (key 48): Yamaha TG77 Ivory Piano (primary) + multiple alternatives - Middle C region
- **G#4** (key 50): Kurzweil K2000 Bright Piano - **Sharp note coverage**
- **B5** (key 53): Casio MT-45 Piano - **Natural note coverage**
- **C#5** (key 55): Casio MT-600 Piano - **Sharp note coverage**

### **Upper Range**
- **F#5** (key 60): Roland SC-88 Grand Piano - Upper mid register
- **F#6** (key 72): Ensoniq VFX-SD Classic Piano - High register
- **F#7** (key 84): Ensoniq SQ-2 Piano - Very high register

### Advanced Sample Selection Algorithm
The engine uses sophisticated chromatic-aware selection:

```rust
// Progressive penalty system for optimal sample selection
if distance == 0 { 0 }                    // Perfect match
else if distance <= 2 { distance }        // Minimal penalty (within major 2nd)  
else if distance <= 6 { distance + 1 }    // Slight penalty (up to tritone)
else if distance <= 12 { distance * 2 }   // Higher penalty (within octave)
else { distance * 3 }                     // Very high penalty (extreme shifts)
```

### **Coverage Benefits**
- **Minimal pitch shifting**: Most keys require â‰¤2 semitones adjustment
- **Natural sharp/flat notes**: Direct samples for G#, C#, and strategic natural notes
- **Professional quality**: Reduced artifacts from excessive pitch shifting
- **Real-time analysis**: System reports coverage gaps and optimization opportunities

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
hound = "3.5"    # WAV file generation and processing
rodio = "0.17"   # Cross-platform audio playback
```

## Performance

- **Memory usage**: ~25MB for comprehensive piano sample collection + minimal game state
- **CPU usage**: Low, optimized cellular automaton calculations with chromatic sample selection
- **Audio latency**: Sub-5ms sample triggering with advanced caching
- **Sample processing**: Real-time pitch shifting and volume compensation
- **Real-time**: 60+ FPS game visualization with professional-quality audio

## Customization

### Adding New Patterns
Add patterns to `game_board.rs`:

```rust
pub fn create_my_pattern(game: &mut GameOfLife, row: usize, col: usize) {
    game.set_cell(row, col, Cell::Alive);
    game.set_cell(row, col + 1, Cell::Alive);
    // ... define your pattern
}
```

### Custom Board Configurations
Create new board generators:

```rust
pub fn create_my_board() -> GameOfLife {
    let mut game = GameOfLife::new();
    Self::create_my_pattern(&mut game, 10, 20);
    // ... add more patterns
    game
}
```

## Known Limitations

- **Sample coverage**: Excellent coverage with minimal pitch shifting (â‰¤2 semitones for most keys)
- **Polyphony**: Limited by system audio capabilities and Rodio mixer performance
- **File size**: Comprehensive piano samples add ~25MB to repository
- **Extreme ranges**: Some very low/high notes still require moderate pitch shifting
- **Sample quality**: Mixed quality from various vintage synthesizer sources
