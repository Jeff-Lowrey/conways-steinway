# Conway's Steinway - Rust Implementation

A Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life that generates piano music based on cellular automaton patterns. Living cells on the bottom row of the game board are interpreted as piano keys, creating emergent musical compositions.

## Overview

This Rust implementation combines Conway's Game of Life with piano audio synthesis. As the cellular automaton evolves, patterns that reach the bottom row trigger piano notes, creating unique musical experiences with each run.

## Features

- Fixed 88Ã—40 game board (width matches piano keys)
- Multiple board initialization types (random, static, fur_elise)
- Piano audio output with sample-based playback
- Chord detection for more musical output
- Standardized configuration system compatible with Python implementation
- Option to run in silent mode (no audio)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Basic audio drivers (typically included with OS)

### Building
```bash
cd rust/life
cargo build --release
```

### Running

You can run the Rust implementation using the included launcher script:

```bash
# From the project root directory
./run-rust.sh

# With custom options
./run-rust.sh --board-type fur_elise --tempo 120
```

Or run it directly with cargo:

```bash
cd rust/life
cargo run

# With options
cargo run -- --board-type fur_elise --silent
```

## Configuration Options

The Rust implementation uses the same standardized configuration system as the Python version:

```
--board-type <type>      Board initialization type (random, static, fur_elise)
--silent                 Disable audio output (audio is enabled by default)
--generations <num>      Generation limit (number or "unlimited")
--step-delay <ms>        Delay between steps in milliseconds
--tempo <bpm>            Musical tempo in beats per minute
--no-detect-chords       Disable automatic chord detection (enabled by default)
--no-pitch-shift         Disable pitch shifting (enabled by default)
```

Configuration is loaded from the following sources (in order of precedence):
1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file (`config/conways_steinway.properties`)

## Architecture

### Core Modules

- `lib.rs`: Core library definitions including Game of Life implementation
- `game_board.rs`: Board manipulation and pattern generators
- `config.rs`: Configuration handling
- `config_loader.rs`: Configuration file loading
- `unified_config.rs`: Shared configuration system
- `audio/audio.rs`: Audio engine for sample playback
- `audio/piano_player.rs`: Piano interface for key mapping

### Game of Life Implementation

The implementation follows Conway's classic rules:
1. Survival: Live cells with 2-3 neighbors survive
2. Birth: Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors become alive
3. Death: All other cells die or remain dead

### Musical Interpretation

1. Piano Mapping: The 88-column board represents piano keys (A0-C8)
2. Note Triggering: Living cells in the bottom row trigger corresponding piano keys
3. Pattern Evolution: The board continuously evolves, creating new musical patterns
4. Chord Detection: Multiple adjacent keys trigger chord playback

## Boolean Flag Standardization

All boolean options follow a standardized approach:

1. Features are **enabled by default**
2. Only the negative flags are provided to disable features
   - `--silent` to disable audio
   - `--no-detect-chords` to disable chord detection
   - `--no-pitch-shift` to disable pitch shifting

## Running Tests

```bash
cd rust/life
cargo test
```
