An implementation of Conway's Game of Life creating player piano instructions, using several different languages and frameworks

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that evolves a set of black and white sqaures according to simple rules.

A full explanation of Conway's Game of Life is not relevant here.

This project adapts the Game of Life board into a scrolling field, and uses this as the paper tape controls for a player piano.

I've implemented this in several different languages, both as a study for myself about thoes languages and an example of my skills.

This is a frivolous project, but is intended and designed to work as part of a highly scalable and observable cloud application running in Kubernetes containers.

Or at least some kind of scalable and observable cloud application running on something - possibly withe backends running serverless or who knows.
